# Calgary-hacks2019
Calgary Transit Smart Kiosk Prototype

This project was developed during Calgary Hacks 2019, which was a 24 hour hackathon. The topic was IoT Smart Cities/Artifical Intelligence
We wanted to develop a more interactive "kiosk" for bus stops and C-Train stations in Calgary.
Travellers would be able to see the current time, temperature, and when the next bus comes at the top.
The middle section would be a map showing routes for the buses that service the particular stop. Users would also be able to lookup directions.
A request help button is also present to improve the safety of bus stops.
